# Kafka-Operator

The Banzai Cloud Kafka operator is a Kubernetes operator to automate provisioning, management, autoscaling and operations of [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) clusters deployed to K8s.

## Overview

Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed streaming platform, and some of the main features of the **Kafka-operator** are:

- the provisioning of secure and production ready Kafka clusters
- **fine grained** broker configuration support
- advanced and highly configurable External Access via LoadBalancers using **Envoy**
- graceful Kafka cluster **scaling and rebalancing**
- monitoring via **Prometheus**
- encrypted communication using SSL
- automatic reaction and self healing based on alerts (plugin system, with meaningful default alert plugins) using **Cruise Control**
- graceful rolling upgrade
- advanced topic and user management via CRD

>We took a different approach to what's out there - we believe for a good reason - please read on to understand more about our [design motivations](docs/features.md) and some of the [scenarios](docs/scenarios.md) which were driving us to create the Banzai Cloud Kafka operator.

The **Banzai Cloud Kafka operator** is a core part of [Banzai Cloud Supertubes](https://banzaicloud.com/products/supertubes/) that helps you create production-ready Kafka cluster on Kubernetes, with scaling, rebalancing, and alerts based self healing. While the Kafka operator itself is an open-source project, the [Banzai Cloud Supertubes](https://banzaicloud.com/products/supertubes/) product extends the functionality of the Kafka operator with commercial features (for example, built-in monitoring and multiple ways of disaster recovery). Read a [detailed comparison of Supertubes and the Kafka operator](https://banzaicloud.com/docs/supertubes/kafka-operator-supertubes-feature-comparison/).
